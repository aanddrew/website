<p>"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide
the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless
sea." <br> - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

<p>Welcome to my personal website.</p

<p>I am a computer science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>

have done. Check out the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> tab or my <a

<p>I am hosting this website and my mail server on a dedicated VPS. Ask me about
my experience with linux! </p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:andrew@weller.fun">shoot me an email</a> if you come across my site! I would love to
test out my mail server with different people.</p>
