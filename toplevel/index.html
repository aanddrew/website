<p>"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide
the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless
sea." <br> - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

<p>To learn a bit about my programming journey you can see some writeups on my early work in the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> tab. 
    
I also have a <a href="https://www.github.com/aanddrew">Github</a> and <a

<p>I like linux, video games, and software engineering.</p>
