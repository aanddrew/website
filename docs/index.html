<p>"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide
the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless
sea." <br> - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

<p>Welcome to my personal website.</p

<p>I am a computer science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this page is to host information about projects I
have done. Check out the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> tab or my <a
href="https://www.github.com/andrewwellercs">Github</a> and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9nEOxnE_cywMkimgEyDyLQ">Youtube</a> for
more info! </p>

<p>I used to host this website and my mail server on a dedicated VPS, but I didn't feel like maintaining it anymore. Ask me about
my experience with linux though!</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:andrew@weller.fun">shoot me an email</a> if you come across my site! I would love to
test out my mail server with different people.</p>
